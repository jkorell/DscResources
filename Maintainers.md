# Maintaining a DSC resource

Maintainers (also referred to as coordinators) are the group of trusted people with knowledges in the resouce domain.

## Maintainers

Maintainers have [write access](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization-repository/) to the repository.
They can:

1. `push`.
2. Merge pull requests.
3. Assign labels, milestones and people to [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

## Dos and don'ts

If you are maintainer, please follow these rules:

1. **DO** reply to the new issues and pull requests (while reviewing PRs, leave your comment even if everything looks good - simple "Looks good to me" or "LGTM" will suffice, so that we know someone has already taken a look at it).
1. **DO** make sure process described in [contributing guide](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) is being followed.
1. **DO** ask people to resend pull request, if it targets [a wrong branch](CONTRIBUTING.md#lifecycle-of-a-pull-request).
**DON'T** merge pull requests to **master** branch.
1. **DO** encourage people to write pester tests for all new functionality.
1. **DO** wait for [CI system](CONTRIBUTING.md#appveyor) build for pull requests.
1. **DO** encourage people to refer issue in PR title/description (e.g. ```Closes #11```). Edit title if necessary
1. **DO** encourage people to create meaningful titles of PR. Edit title if necessary.
1. **DO** verify [style guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResources/blob/master/StyleGuidelines.md) are being followed.
1. **DO** ensure that each contributor has signed a valid Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
1. **DO** verify compliance with any third party code license terms (e.g., requiring attribution, etc.) if the contribution contains such third party code.

1. **DON'T** merge pull requests with failed CI build.
1. **DON'T** merge pull requests, without label `cla-signed` or `cla-not-required` by Microsoft CLA bot.
1. **DON'T** merge pull requests, that doesn't [reflect changes](CONTRIBUTING.md#lifecycle-of-a-pull-request) in **Unreleased** version in `README.md`.
1. **DON'T** merge your own pull requests before they were reviewed by someone else.

## Labeling workflows

### Labeling of issues

1. Issue is created
1. Maintainer assigns one of the following labels: ```bug```, ```enhancement```, ```discussion```, ```question```
  1. In some cases, special labels may be used (e.g. ```new module``` for issue requesting new DSC resource module in DscResources repository)
  1. If issue is duplicate of another issue, ```duplicate``` label is added and issue is closed
  1. If for some reason issue should not be fixed, ```wontfix``` label is added and comment with explaination should be provided.
1. Maintainer assigns ```up for grabs``` label to let contributors know this issue needs someone who will take care of it
1. Once one of the maintainers or contributors volunteers to work on given issue, ```up for grabs``` label is replaced with ```in progress```
1. Once issue is fixed, we replace label ```in progress``` with ```ready```

### Labeling of pull requests
1. Pull request is opened
2. Maintainer takes a look at the Pull Request and either reviews it immediately or assigns ```need review``` label
3. After code review is completed, PR is either merged (if everything looks good) or feedback is provided and ```need review``` label is replaced with ```waiting for the author```
4. Once the author of PR addresses all comments, we come back to step 3. 

#### Abandoned pull requests
Sometimes pull request stays with label ```waiting for the author``` for a long time (2+ weeks) without hearing back from the original author, in those cases:

1. Ping the author of PR to remind him of pending changes (hopefully he responds, addresses code review comments, tests are passing and we can merge)
2. If he doesnâ€™t respond (for a week or more) and our comments are very minor, we should merge the change and immediately send the new PR addressing those minor comments so that they are in as well.
3. If changes required to bring PR to mergeable state are significant, we should branch the code, bring in their changes and open new PR. Mention in the description original PR ID so that we know where that code originated from. Then we can close original PR. 
4. If changes in abandoned PR are no longer needed (e.g. due to refactoring of the codebase or design change), we can simply close PR.
